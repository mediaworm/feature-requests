## Feature Requests ##
Hello there. Welcome to the feature requests repository. You maybe wondering why a separate repository for only feature requests? Well, in this way it becomes easy for us to keep a track of things. 

### How do I get set up? ###
You can make a feature request by clicking on the **[Issues](https://github.com/mediaworm/feature-requests/issues)** tab and then clicking on the New Issue button. Submit your request and we will have a look at your at it. 

### How long does it take for the requested feature to be implemented? ###
There is no definite time limit. Can take up to a couple of days/weeks/months. Depends on the priority and importance of the requested feature.

### Who do I talk to? ###

* Repo owner or admin
